# javascript and classes

- Javascript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specificaiton (often reffered to as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarly a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarly syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java of C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
